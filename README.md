Problem Statement
Indian Premier League (IPL) is a league for Twenty20 (T20) cricket championships started in India. The auction price of the player depends on his performance in test matches or one-day internationals. The primary skill of the player also contributes to the auction price. We use different regression techniques to predict the auction price of the player.
